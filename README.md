What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was solving problems regarding data structures and algorithms for both projects. Project one analyzed how data structures run time and memory are executed. The examples of data structures used were arrays, linked lists, vectors, and Binary trees. Project two took my analysis and allowed me to code the Project for sorting, printing, and displaying a list of courses in alphanumeric order.  



How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Approaching the problem consisted of understanding what was being asked of me. The requirements are the main priority when dealing with the Project. The next step was to see what data structure was best for the implementation of this system. I chose Vector. Finally, optimizing the code for performance and memory usage demands. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Some roadblocks I encountered were learning the data structures algorithm techniques and implementation tactics. I was able to overcome this by looking further into the topics, reviewing the course work, feedback from the instructor, and taking rigorous notes. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work has improved my understanding of the management of data structures and how choosing them affects the entire system. I took more time to think of the run time and memory usage I needed for a project. It also helped improve my management of error handling and readability. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work has evolved from this project by teaching me to understand the importance of data structure management. Overall, working on the projects has been a valuable learning experience that has expanded my programming skills and improved my approach to writing software.
